    <h1><i>Among Us</i></h1>
    
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Gameplay">Gameplay</span></h2>

<p><i>Among Us</i> is a multiplayer game for four to fifteen players (previously four to ten players), although recommended for at least five. Up to three players are randomly and secretly chosen to be the Impostor(s) each round. As of 2021, a round can take place on one of four maps: a spaceship called "The Skeld"; a headquarters building called "MIRA HQ"; a planet base called "Polus"; or an airship based on Innersloth's <i>Henry Stickmin</i> series called "The Airship".
</p>

<p>The Impostor(s) win(s) one of two ways: either by killing most of the crew (to the point that they're equal in number) or by sabotaging a critical system on the map (provided the Crewmates don't resolve it in time). The Crewmates likewise can win one of two ways: either by completing all tasks or by identifying and ejecting all Impostors. Games can also end by players quitting the match if doing so fulfills any win condition (if a Crewmate quits the game, their tasks are automatically considered completed).
</p>

<p>At the start of the game, Crewmates are assigned "tasks" to complete around the map (in the form of minigames, minipuzzles, and simple toggles), mostly consisting of maintenance work on vital systems such as fixing wires and downloading data. Impostors are given a fake list of suggested tasks to blend in with Crewmates. However, they cannot legitimately perform tasks and can only pretend to be doing any of the tasks on the ship. Impostors, however, can sabotage vital systems (such as The Skeld's oxygen supply), close the doors to rooms, quickly and covertly travel through the ventilation system (commonly referred to as "venting"), and kill Crewmates when standing near them. To help the Crewmates identify Impostors, there are various surveillance systems on each map, such as security cameras and an admin system on The Skeld, a doorlog system with sensors in MIRA HQ, and a vitals indicator in Polus. Crewmates may also confirm their identity through "visual tasks" (tasks that have animations which play for other players), which cannot be faked by Impostors.
</p>

<p>If a Crewmate is killed or any player is voted out and ejected, they become a ghost. Ghosts can pass through walls, watch other players' activities, and see and chat with other ghosts. Living players have a limited cone of vision ghosts do not. Moreover, ghosts cannot communicate with living players or be seen by them. Ghosts help their living teammates by completing their tasks (as a Crewmate) or performing various acts of sabotage (as an Impostor).
</p>

<p>Any living player may call a group meeting by reporting a dead body, or by pressing the Emergency Meeting button on the map at any time (except during major sabotages, when Emergency Meetings cannot be called, but dead bodies can still be reported). During a meeting, players discuss who they believe is an Impostor based on the available evidence. Impostors can be identified beyond all reasonable doubt if they are seen <i>venting</i> or <i>killing</i>. A player may be suspected for many other reasons though. However, all the players form a sort of jury and must weigh the veracity or value of each other's statements and questions during the meeting. A plurality vote is held, and if a plurality is obtained, the player whom the most crewmates voted is ejected from the map and they become a ghost, unless the majority of the crewmates choose to skip vote or there is a tie vote. Players can communicate in a built-in text chat (with some predefined phrases for phone users), but only during meetings, and only if they are alive (though ghosts can speak with one another at any time). While the game does not have a built-in voice chat system, it is common for players to use external programs such as Discord or to converse regularly if they are in close physical proximity to one another. In case players can hear each other's voices, the game reminds them to not speak except during meetings.
</p>

<p>In November 2021, additional roles were made available to players extending beyond the standard Crewmate or Impostor roles. Crewmates can also be Engineers, Scientists, or Guardian Angels. Engineers allow Crewmates to travel through vents like Impostors can, albeit to a limited capacity. Scientists can check vitals at any time to see if any player has been killed recently. Crewmates who become Ghosts can become Guardian Angels, which can temporarily protect living players from being killed. Impostors likewise can be Shapeshifters, allowing them to temporarily morph into other players. 
</p>

<p>In each game's lobby, various options can be adjusted to customize aspects of gameplay, such as player movement speed, the allowed number of emergency meetings, number of tasks, if there will be "visual tasks", or whether or not an Impostor is revealed after being voted off. There are also many cosmetic options, including spacesuit colors, skins, hats, and pets, some of which are paid downloadable content.

<p><i>Among Us</i> was inspired by the live <a href="/wiki/Party_game" title="Party game">party game</a> <a href="/wiki/Mafia_(party_game)" title="Mafia (party game)"><i>Mafia</i></a>,<sup id="cite_ref-:7_6-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:7-6">&#91;5&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:16_40-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:16-40">&#91;35&#93;</a></sup> and the <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction_horror" class="mw-redirect" title="Science fiction horror">science fiction horror</a> film <a href="/wiki/The_Thing_(1982_film)" title="The Thing (1982 film)"><i>The Thing</i></a>.<sup id="cite_ref-:33_41-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:33-41">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup> The idea for the concept was originally given by Marcus Bromander, co-founder of Innersloth, who had played <i>Mafia</i> since he was a kid. In the original game, function cards were dealt and players wandered around a house, aimlessly, while another person secretly killed the players, drawing a finger around their neck. Most of its mechanics were still present in <i>Among Us</i>, but the team wanted to "alleviate the need to create an interesting home model and have someone wandering around in a boring environment". So, they decided that the game would be space themed and also added tasks, which, according to Forest Willard, programmer at Innersloth, "changed several times during development".<sup id="cite_ref-:33_41-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:33-41">&#91;36&#93;</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-:28_42-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-:28-42">&#91;37&#93;</a></sup>

This led to a steady increase in players, causing the game's player base to <a href="/wiki/Snowball_effect" title="Snowball effect">snowball</a>.
